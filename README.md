## RESTful API using Java/SpringBoot

This project was developed for the React.JS course made by Matheus Battisti, where in the backend he used Node.js and Express to develop the API.

How am I improving my backend knowledge and studying Java, I developed the API with Java.

üíª Technologies ‚Äã‚Äãused:
- Java 17
- Framework SpringBoot
- PostgreSQL
- Deploy with Railway

In this system, I tried to apply a **Clean Architecture**.
Using OOP concepts to bring more security to the software.

üåç The idea behind the system is: a social network to share your photos with the world.<br />

‚ú® This is a project for my development personal as FullStack, using Java on the backend, PostgreSQL database and React.JS on the front end.
